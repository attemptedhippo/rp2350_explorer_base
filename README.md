This is a bare minimum working codebase for the pimoroni explorer.
NOT to be confused with the pico explorer, learned after many hours of hair pulling.

I haven't tested any other functions besides getting the screen working and printing to the usb serial debug console.

The included flash.sh must be run with sudo, and don't forget to use `chmod +x` first!
(not to be confused with -x because that removes the executable flag, also learned after an unreasonable amount of hair pulling)
